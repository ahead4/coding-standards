# Versioning

We should use Semantic Versioning for our Version Numbers http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

At it's basics a version is defined as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH and you increment as follows:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes (Would it break anything?)
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a way that doesn't break anything existing.
3. PATCH version when fixing bugs.

You're also allowed to add pre-release/build metadata (-beta, -rc.2, etc.)

You should take a look at the Semantic Versioning Specification: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html around 1/4 down the page.
